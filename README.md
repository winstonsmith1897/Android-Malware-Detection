# Android-Malware-Detection
## Introduction
My study will focus on the Classification of APKs in these different categories:
1. Benign APK : Harmless or well intentioned application, the opposite of
malicious APKs.
2. File Infector APK : A file infector is a type of malware that has the
capability to propagate by attaching its code to other programs or
files.
3. Riskware APK : Riskware is any potentially unwanted application that
is not classified as malware, but may utilize system resources in an
undesirable or annoying manner, and/or may pose a security risk.
4. Trojan APK : A trojan is a type of malware that performs activites with-
out the userâ€™s knowledge. These activities commonly include estab-
lishing remote access connections, capturing keyboard input, collect-
ing system information, downloading/uploading files, dropping other
malware into the infected system, performing denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks, and running/terminating processes.
5. Adware APK : Adware typically display advertising content to the user.
This advertising content may take many forms, but is typically in the
form of web browser pop-up advertisements. In most circumstances,
the user is not aware of the Adware component being installed on the
local machine.
